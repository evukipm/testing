        In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have... 
        Nah, being serious...
        <br/><br/>
        I'm passionate about reading and writing, but I 
        <span>â™¥</span> 
        coding too, cause,and don't laught about it, 
        it's kinda creative and it's in creativity where 
        I find happiness. 
        <br/><br/>
        Like a crazy scientist: I like to experiment with the technologies that I use to expand my knowledge about them, 
        so if you are interested in my progress you can see the result of that here, in my personal lab.
